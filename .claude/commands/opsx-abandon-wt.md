description: Abandon an in-progress change and tear down its worktree
---

The change `$ARGUMENTS` is being abandoned (rejected direction, superseded,
or no longer needed). Tear down the worktree and branch.

**Steps:**

1. Confirm with the user what exactly they want to abandon:
   - Just the worktree + branch (implementation attempt), keeping the proposal on main?
   - The whole change, proposal included?

2. Run `./scripts/opsx-abandon-worktree.sh $ARGUMENTS` to remove the worktree
   and delete the `feature/$ARGUMENTS` branch. The script prompts for
   confirmation before destructive actions.

3. If the user also wants to drop the proposal from main, do that separately:
   - `rm -rf openspec/changes/$ARGUMENTS` (if the proposal was never committed)
   - or `git revert <proposal-commit>` (if it was committed and pushed)
   - or `git rm -r openspec/changes/$ARGUMENTS && git commit` (if committed but not yet pushed to a shared branch)

   Pick the right option based on the git state — ask the user which
   applies if it's not obvious.
