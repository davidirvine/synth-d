# PR Previews

## Purpose

Defines the automatic preview-deployment workflow for pull requests targeting `main` — when a preview build is deployed, the stable URL it is served at, and its lifecycle.

## Requirements

### Requirement: PRs to main receive a preview deployment
The system SHALL automatically deploy a preview build for every pull request targeting `main`. The preview SHALL be available at a stable URL for the lifetime of the PR.

#### Scenario: Preview deployed when PR is opened
- **WHEN** a pull request targeting `main` is opened
- **THEN** the preview workflow builds the application (including Faust WASM)
- **THEN** the build is deployed to `gh-pages/pr-preview/pr-<number>/`
- **THEN** a comment is posted on the PR with the preview URL

#### Scenario: Preview updated when PR receives new commits
- **WHEN** a pull request targeting `main` is synchronised (new commits pushed)
- **THEN** the preview workflow rebuilds and redeploys to the same `gh-pages/pr-preview/pr-<number>/` path
- **THEN** the preview URL remains stable

#### Scenario: Preview cleaned up when PR is closed
- **WHEN** a pull request targeting `main` is closed (merged or abandoned)
- **THEN** the preview workflow removes the `gh-pages/pr-preview/pr-<number>/` directory
- **THEN** the preview URL no longer serves content
- **THEN** the production root of `gh-pages` is not affected

### Requirement: Preview deployments do not affect production
Preview builds SHALL be isolated to subdirectories of `gh-pages` and SHALL NOT overwrite or interfere with the production deployment at the root of the `gh-pages` branch.

#### Scenario: Production root unaffected by preview deploy
- **WHEN** a preview deployment runs
- **THEN** only `gh-pages/pr-preview/pr-<number>/` is written
- **THEN** the root `index.html` and all other production files remain unchanged
