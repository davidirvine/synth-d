## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Feedback delay DSP stage inserted post-VCA
The system SHALL implement a feedback delay stage in `faust/synth.dsp` positioned after the VCA (amp envelope × VCA output) and before master volume. The delay SHALL use `de.sdelay(96000, 1024, delayTime * ma.SR)` for smooth, click-free time changes. The feedback loop SHALL recirculate the delay output scaled by `delayFeedback`, capped at 0.9 via `ba.clip(-1, 0.9)` to prevent unbounded buildup. The wet/dry blend SHALL be controlled by `delayMix` (0–1). A `delayOn` parameter (0 or 1, default 0) SHALL bypass the entire delay stage via `select2` when 0. Default values: `delayOn` = 0, `delayTime` = 0.3 s, `delayFeedback` = 0.3, `delayMix` = 0.3.

#### Scenario: delayOn at zero bypasses the delay
- **WHEN** `delayOn` is 0
- **THEN** the VCA output passes through unchanged with no delay repeats audible

#### Scenario: delayOn at one activates delay repeats
- **WHEN** `delayOn` is 1 and `delayMix` is greater than 0
- **THEN** audible delay repeats are heard after the initial note

#### Scenario: Delay repeats ring freely after VCA closes
- **WHEN** `delayOn` is 1, `delayFeedback` is greater than 0, and the note is released (VCA closes)
- **THEN** delay repeats continue to decay after the VCA output reaches zero

#### Scenario: Mix at zero passes dry signal only
- **WHEN** `delayOn` is 1 and `delayMix` is 0
- **THEN** no delay repeats are audible; only the dry signal is present

#### Scenario: Mix at one passes wet signal only
- **WHEN** `delayOn` is 1 and `delayMix` is 1
- **THEN** the output consists entirely of the delay wet signal; the dry signal is absent

#### Scenario: Feedback at zero produces single repeat
- **WHEN** `delayOn` is 1, `delayFeedback` is 0, and `delayMix` is greater than 0
- **THEN** a single delayed copy of the signal is heard with no further repeats

#### Scenario: Feedback near 0.9 produces long-decaying repeats
- **WHEN** `delayOn` is 1 and `delayFeedback` is 0.9
- **THEN** multiple repeats are audible, decaying slowly over several seconds

#### Scenario: Feedback is capped at 0.9 in the DSP
- **WHEN** `delayFeedback` is set to any value via UI or MIDI CC
- **THEN** the signal fed back into the delay never exceeds 0.9, preventing self-oscillation

#### Scenario: Time change is smooth with no clicks
- **WHEN** `delayTime` is adjusted while `delayOn` is 1 and audio is playing
- **THEN** the delay time transitions without audible clicks or discontinuities

### Requirement: Delay UI panel with on/off toggle and three MIDI-learnable knobs
The system SHALL provide a `Delay.svelte` component containing an on/off toggle button (controlling `delayOn`) and three `Knob` components labelled `time`, `feedback`, and `mix`. The toggle SHALL use the same button style as the Glide panel (active state: amber highlight; inactive: grey). The component SHALL accept `onchange`, `midiState`, and `onknobcontextmenu` props following the same contract as existing panel components. The `delayTime`, `delayFeedback`, and `delayMix` knobs SHALL participate in the MIDI CC learn workflow. `delayOn` is not MIDI-learnable.

#### Scenario: Toggle defaults to off
- **WHEN** the Delay panel is rendered with no external state
- **THEN** the toggle button displays "off" and delay is inactive

#### Scenario: Toggle sends delayOn param
- **WHEN** the on/off toggle is clicked from the off state
- **THEN** `onchange` is called with `{ param: 'delayOn', value: 1 }`

#### Scenario: Time knob defaults to 0.3 s
- **WHEN** the Delay panel is rendered with no external state
- **THEN** the time knob displays 0.3 s

#### Scenario: Knob change dispatches correct param name
- **WHEN** the feedback knob is adjusted
- **THEN** `onchange` is called with `{ param: 'delayFeedback', value: <new value> }`

#### Scenario: MIDI learn context menu triggers for each knob
- **WHEN** the user right-clicks any of the three delay knobs
- **THEN** `onknobcontextmenu` is called with the corresponding param name (`delayTime`, `delayFeedback`, or `delayMix`)

#### Scenario: External MIDI value updates knob display
- **WHEN** `midiState.delayTime.externalValue` is updated by an incoming CC message
- **THEN** the time knob reflects the new value visually

---

### Requirement: Delay parameters registered in MIDI CC map
The system SHALL register `delayTime` (range 0.01–1.0 s), `delayFeedback` (range 0–0.9), and `delayMix` (range 0–1) as learnable parameters in the `KNOB_PARAMS` registry in `App.svelte`, following the same pattern as existing parameters. `delayOn` is not registered.

#### Scenario: Delay time responds to assigned CC
- **WHEN** a MIDI CC is assigned to `delayTime` and a CC message is received
- **THEN** `delayTime` is updated by the engine via the standard CC routing path

#### Scenario: Delay params appear in CC learn UI
- **WHEN** the user right-clicks a delay knob and enters MIDI learn mode
- **THEN** the knob enters learn state and captures the next incoming CC number

---

### Requirement: Delay panel mounted after Amp Env in App.svelte
The system SHALL mount the `Delay` panel in `App.svelte` after the `AmpEnv` panel, reflecting the post-VCA position of the delay in the signal chain.

#### Scenario: Delay panel is visible in the UI
- **WHEN** the application loads
- **THEN** a panel labelled "delay" is visible in the synthesizer interface, positioned after the amp env panel

#### Scenario: Delay panel wires onchange to engine
- **WHEN** a delay knob value or toggle changes
- **THEN** the corresponding parameter is sent to the DSP engine via the existing `setParam` path
